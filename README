Source diving:
    - monad.sml 
        of *course* SML has monadic computation.
        Please see IO.unsafePerformIO
    - load.sml 
        There is nothing important to say about this file.
        Please see magic : real -> real. We are serious. 
    - super.sml
        A supercomlliding supercompiler.
        Please proceed quickly to the end of the structure. 
        Prolonged exposure to the compiler is not a part of this competition.

        This file does not work. Can YOU spot why?

        Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.

        The least terrifying file in this codebase.

Description of algorithms:
The core attack algorithm is to build up a zombie attack very quickly, which
uses zombies on the opponent side to `help' themselves to death. Michael
Arntzenius spent three hours redesigning our loader to shave one cycle 
from our attack sequence. Once the attack has been launched, 

We have three separate implementations of board state search. Search.search 
breadth-first searches for the shortest path from one slot state to another.
We have an abstract expression equivalence checker (and thus minimizer). We
also can use game tree search to look ahead to find attacks.

We thought it would be important to be able to write more expressive code in
the untyped lambda calculus, but instead, Marty Rosenberg provided us
with custom assembly codes.

None of our infrastructure is used heavily.

But, we have the fastest draw in the west.
